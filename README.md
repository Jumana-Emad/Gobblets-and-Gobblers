#IMPORTANT NOTE:
At the moment , The project is divided into 2, one gui appthat works perfectly for pvp and easy level for pvc and cvc  and a console project that works great for medium and hard level (minimax with evaluation)
(Faced issues in integration of codes, so missed th deadline)

Welcome to the **Gobblet AI Player** project! Immerse yourself in the intriguing game of Gobblet, an abstract strategy game where players strategically place and move pieces to form winning combinations. Here's what you'll find in this repository:

### Game Overview
Gobblet is played on a 4x4 grid, challenging players to create stacks of four pieces in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal rows. With each player having twelve pieces of varying sizes, the game demands strategic moves and careful memory recall.

### Components
- 16-square playing board
- 12 white Gobblets
- 12 black Gobblets
- [Game Rules](https://www.boardspace.net/gobblet/english/gobblet_rules.pdf): Detailed instructions on how to play the game.

### GUI Features
The graphical user interface (GUI) provides an engaging experience, supporting human vs. human, human vs. computer, and computer vs. computer gameplay. Key features include:
1. **Board Display:** Visualize the game board and current piece placements.
2. **Move Input:** Human players can make moves by clicking on the board.
3. **Game Status:** Indication of whose turn it is and whether the game has concluded.
4. **Game Options:** Choose game modes, set AI player difficulty levels, and initiate or restart games.

### Project Implementation
The project is flexible, allowing you to implement it using any programming language and framework of your choice.

### Game Playing Algorithms
Explore sophisticated game-playing algorithms, including:
1. **Minimax Algorithm:** A fundamental search algorithm examining possible moves to select the optimal one.
2. **Alpha-Beta Pruning:** An enhancement to minimax, reducing the number of nodes to be searched.
3. **Iterative Deepening:** Alpha-beta pruning with iterative deepening, dynamically adjusting the search depth.

### Heuristics
Incorporate heuristic evaluations into your gameplay, providing intelligent decision-making. The repository encourages the use of at least one heuristic, with comprehensive documentation on heuristic descriptions and approximations.
